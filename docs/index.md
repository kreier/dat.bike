This repository is used to collect and document parts of the development of this Vietnamese electric motorcycle startup.

## Version 1

After some prototyping in California during 2018 this bike was produced eventually in Vietnam and a dozen was rented out and sold. The rental shop opened at the beginning of 2019 in [Da Nang](https://youtu.be/OHJpOSwf7EA) at [23 Nguyễn Thái Học](https://goo.gl/maps/p3gNxgxKgGf4U6ET7).

The 1.5 kW motor was mounted on the bottom of the frame and connected to the rear wheel with a chain. That changed at the end of 2019.

## Version 2

As an upgrade the motor moved to the rear axis and the main operation moved to Ho Chi Minh City and Bing Duong. Peak power is now 5 kW.
