We add $2 kg$ for the 17” rim, $1 kg$ for the 36 spokes and $2.9 kg$ for the 80/90-17 Michelin (Metzler?) tire. The swingarm might have $5 kg$, but is on one side fixed on the sprung mass.

        "A jump of $21 centimeter$ is something the rider would certainly feel. The rubber of the tire reduces, the suspension takes part of it and there is 2cm foam on the seat left. Let’s compare to the upgraded drive train. Total mass of 50kg is unchanged, but the acceleration is now a = (m1 + m2)g / m1 = 50/12.2g = 4.10g = 40.2 m/s2 .  And we get (1) h = 2 * (1.5)2 / 40.2 = 0.11m and (2) t = 2 * 1.5 / 40.2 = 0.07 s. The reduction in jump and airtime is proportional to the weight reduction of the unsprung mass, almost 50%! One can imagine how much better the ride over the same street with the same diameter of wheels and the same weight of the bike will be if the wheel only elongates 11cm instead of 22cm. And only for half the time. This might be completely absorbed by the suspension and the seat, you don’t even feel it.\n",

        "If the rear wheel has a maximum upward limit of 22 centimeters from its center point we can use this height to determine the spring constant. Completely compressed it should hold the maximum load of 215kg, where the empty bike is 85kg. The rear gets 50kg or 59% of all load, so the maximum load for the rear is 126kg. There should be a safety margin of at least 2cm. The spring would then compress by 20cm if we change the rear load from 50kg to 126kg, and increase of 76kg or 746 Newton. The spring constant from F = Ds is then D = F/s = 746 N / 0.2m = 3730 N/m The calculated force FS for the current drive train is then at the highest point no longer FS = m2g but FS = m2g + 746 N. The total force there is then Ftop = 50kg * 9.81 m/s2 + 746N= 491 N + 746 N = 1237 N. More than twice the force from neutral. The acceleration there would be a = F/m = 1237N/22.9kg = 54 m/s2. This reduces all values above mentioned. You still feel the higher impact from the almost double kinetic energy of the unsprung mass that has to be absorbed, stored in spring energy and released back to the wheel. Part of this energy makes it to your back, you feel it. And you describe your ride as “not very comfortable”. Guess why all major electric bike manufacturers (Gogoro, Zero bikes, Kymco, Pega, Harley Davidson, unu, Vespa) move the motor away from the rear axis for real motorbikes, not bicycle replacements. OK, the Super Soco TC looks similar to dat.bike, is a little more expensive, but the Max relocates the motor!"

Reduced by 67% it only contributes with 3.8kg. The unsprung mass is therefore 3.8+2+1+2.9+2.5 = 12.2kg. Thats only 53% of the current design, 47% less unsprung mass! What is the effect?"
